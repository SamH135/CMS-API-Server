HOW TO RUN:

    - Download node.js if you don't already have it

    - Clone the repository

    - cd to project directory

    - In the terminal run these commands:

        npm init -y

        npm install express pg dotenv express-session body-parser connect-pg-simple cors bcryptjs jsonwebtoken nodemon

        npm start

    NOTE: 
        don't forget to add "start" script to package.json file

        ex:
        "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
            "start": "node app.js"
        },





Development notes/goals:

    determine any extra features to make ready for production

    need to add receipt view logic/queries - also to FE
        - sum(receipts weights and payout) = totals on clientInfo

    test cron tasks

    add createClient() to add clients

    need to add logic to determine when clients need pickups based on their last pickupdate and time in between

    connect last pickup to last receipt -> unless manually changed (update pickupdate)

    consider adding queries to make more interesting displays in front end
